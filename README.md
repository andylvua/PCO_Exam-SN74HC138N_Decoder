## Task:
Test the SN74HC138N 3 to 8 decoder. For all combinations of A, B, C test if the correct Y0-Y7 are set.


### Implementation details:
* The SN74HC138N 3 to 8 decoder is tested by setting A, B, C to all possible combinations and checking if the correct Y0-Y7 are set.
* The A, B, C pins are set by the set_SELECT function.
* The Y0-Y7 pins are read by the read_OUTPUT function.
* The ERROR_blink function is called if the test fails.
* The onetime_OK_blink function is called if the test passes.
*
* During the testing, the BLUE LED will blink on each successful test, and the ORANGE LED will blink on each failed test.
* If the test fails, the RED LED will blink.
* If decoder works correctly, the GREEN LED will light up continuously.
